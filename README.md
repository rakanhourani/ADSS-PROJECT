# ADSS-PROJECT: Cryptocurrency Information Web & API

## Overview
The Cryptocurrency Web is a user-friendly web platform built on PythonAnywhere with TinyDB for data management and developed through the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). It offers a seamless experience for users to explore and analyse key financial metrics of the top 42 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, directly sourced from Yahoo Finance and Coin Market Cap ([https://coinmarketcap.com/](URL)). 

The web platform emphasises ease of use, providing users with insights into prices, trends, and market capitalisation, empowering informed investment decisions. Future enhancements aim to refine the user experience further, adding more personalized features, having up-to-date information, and comprehensive data interpretation resources.

### Core Functionalities:
__Search Capability:__ Users can select their choice from a dropdown menu loaded with the names of cryptocurrencies from the dataset.

__Information Display:__ Upon selection, the system presents essential details about the chosen cryptocurrency on a separate page.

### Coding Tools:
Developed on PythonAnywhere's (Python 3.10) free trial

## Libraries
Several Python libraries are instrumental for this application, including Flask for web serving, Pandas for data manipulation, and TinyDB as a lightweight database. To set up, use the following commands in the PythonAnywhere Bash Console:

- pip install pandas
- pip install tinydb
- pip install flask

## Installation
Accessing the Cryptocurrency Web Platform requires no installation. To begin exploring the financial insights it offers, simply follow the direct link associated with this repository.

## Usage 
1. Download the ZIP file from the repository. It contains a README, the primary Python file (flask_app.py), a sample HTML template, and an accompanying .csv dataset.
2. Transfer the flask_app.py and the Cryptocurrencies.csv into the PythonAnywhere designated 'mysite' folder.
3. Place the HTML template file into the 'templates' subfolder of 'mysite'
4. Adjust the dataset path within the flask_app.py script to align with your PythonAnywhere file structure.
5. Save changes and refresh all components to ensure smooth functionality.
6. You can now open your project at [clementinemathieu.pythonanywhere.com](URL)
