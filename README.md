# ADSS-PROJECT: Cryptocurrency Information Web & API
By Nour Farhat, Leopoldo Sirolli, Clementine Mathieu, Rakan Hourani

## Overview
This project is part of the curriculum for the Advanced Data Structures & Storage course. The platform serves as a simple, user-friendly web interface and API to retrieve and display key data about various cryptocurrencies.

### Core Functionalities:
__Search Capability:__ Users can input a cryptocurrency name or abreviated symbol or they can also select their choice from a dropdown menu loaded with the names from the dataset.

__Information Display:__ Upon selection, the system presents essential details about the chosen cryptocurrency on a separate page.

### Coding Tools:
Developed on PythonAnywhere's (Python 3.10) free trial

## Libraries
Several Python libraries are instrumental for this application, including Flask for web serving, Pandas for data manipulation, TinyDB as a lightweight database, and the OS library for operating system interactions. To set up, use the following commands in the PythonAnywhere Bash Console:

- pip install pandas
- pip install tinydb
- pip install flask
- pip install os

## Download
1. Download the ZIP file from the repository. It contains a README, the primary Python file (flask_app.py), a sample HTML template, and an accompanying .csv dataset.
2. Transfer the flask_app.py and the Cryptocurrencies.csv into the PythonAnywhere designated 'mysite' folder.
3. Place the HTML template file into the 'templates' subfolder of 'mysite'
4. Adjust the dataset path within the flask_app.py script to align with your PythonAnywhere file structure.
5. Save changes and refresh all components to ensure smooth functionality.
